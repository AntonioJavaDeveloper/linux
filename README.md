This introductory chapter presents the two fundamental pillars for understanding how Linux works: the **kernel**, which is the core of the operating system, and the **distributions**, which are Linux variations tailored for different purposes, audiences, and environments.

Before exploring the directory structure, permissions, processes, and automations, it's essential to understand what Linux truly is — and how it manifests in different forms across the distribution ecosystem.

## 🗂️ Chapter Organization

This chapter is divided into two main sections, each with its own file:

| Section                                                      | Description                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [🔧 01 - Linux Kernel](./1-kernel.md)                         | Explains what the kernel is, its role in the system, and how it interacts with hardware and processes. |
| [📦 02 - Linux Distributions](./2-distributions.md)           | Introduces the concept of distributions, differences between distros, and how to choose the right one. |
| [🧪 03 - Hands-on Lab](./3-hands-on-summary.md)               | Practical exercises with real commands in Vagrant environments (Ubuntu and Rocky) to consolidate the concepts. |
